To view my draw.io diagrams you'll need to add the Draw.io Integration extension in VS Code or will have to open these with
Draw.io.  I wasn't sure of a better way to do this in integration with github so this is the route we're going. 
Below is the link to the extension.


Name: Draw.io Integration

Description: This unofficial extension integrates Draw.io into VS Code.
